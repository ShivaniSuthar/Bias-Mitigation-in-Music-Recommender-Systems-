# Bias-Mitigation-in-Music-Recommender-Systems-

In this project, my team and I developed a music recommender system to mitigate regional bias in music recommendations based on the artist’s country of origin. We utilized large datasets from Last.fm and MusicBrainz API and implemented singular value decomposition using Python’s sklearn for collaborative filtering to predict user preferences. We mitigated regional bias by reweighting scores for underrepresented artists, resulting in a 300x improvement in visibility for these artists while maintaining recommendation quality.

(This was my data science senior capstone project completed on a team with Joshua Brusewitz, Sam Horio, and Natalie Wu. The website for this project (linked below) also contains links to our project's code repository and written report.)
